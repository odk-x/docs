Excel Worksheets
------------------------------

A workbook is composed of one or more worksheets. XLSX Converter expects the worksheets within a workbook to use the following nomenclature.

.. list-table:: Worksheet Reference Table
  :header-rows: 1
  :name: worksheet-reference-table

  * - Worksheet
    - Required?
    - | Description
  * - :ref:`survey <xlsx-ref-survey>`
    - Required
    - | Contains the content and control flow of the
      | survey. It contains the full list of questions
      | and determines the order in which they will be
      | asked. This worksheet can be broken into
      | different section worksheets for ease of use.
  * - :ref:`settings <xlsx-ref-settings>`
    - Required
    - | Includes such details as the form name and id,
      | as well as the default language.

      | Translations specific to a given :th:`table_id`.

.. note::

  Each worksheet has a set of required and optional columns. For the XLSX workbook to be valid, all entries must have legal values in the required columns. Optional columns can be left blank at any point, and omitted entirely if not used.

.. _xlsx-ref-survey:

Survey
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All XLSX Converter form definitions require a **survey** sheet. The **survey** worksheet contains the structure and most of the content of the form. It contains the full list of questions and information about how those questions should be presented. Most rows represent a question; the rest of the rows specify control structures such as screen groups. Blank rows are ignored.

.. note::

  In this document, questions and question types will also be referred to as prompts and prompt types.

There are many prompts available for form development. Some ask the user a question and get a response, but other prompts are simply informational and referring to them as questions is not semantically correct.

.. _xlsx-ref-survey-req-cols:

Required Columns
"""""""""""""""""""""""

A list of the required columns for a **survey** worksheet follows.

.. list-table:: Survey Worksheet Required Columns
  :header-rows: 1
  :name: survey-worksheet-required-columns

  * - Column

  * - type
    - | The prompt type that will be used to display information to the user. Prompt
      | types can also be used to get data from a user.

    - | The name of the prompt type. This name will be used throughout the workbook
      | to reference the prompt.
  * - display.prompt
    - | A string token identifying the translation entry that can define the text,
      | audio, image and video to display for this prompt.
      |
      | Alternatively, this column can be omitted and the prompt text can be
      | specified directly via the :th:`display.prompt.text` column.

.. _xlsx-ref-survey-opt-cols:

Optional Columns
"""""""""""""""""""""""

A list of the optional columns that can be incorporated into a **survey** worksheet is below.

.. list-table:: Survey Worksheet Optional Columns
  :header-rows: 1

      | contains control flow options such as :tc:`if`, and the :th:`condition`
      | column contains a predicate to determine if action will occur.
      | :tc:`if` statements always require a :th:`condition` statement. For other
      | :th:`clause` statements, a blank :th:`condition` column is assumed to
      | be true. Other commands include :tc:`begin screen`, :tc:`end screen`,
      | and :tc:`do section`.

      |
      | Alternatively, this can be specified on the translations sheet
      | under the :th:`display.prompt` string token (under the
      | :th:`display.audio` column heading).
  * - display.prompt.image

      | column of the **survey** worksheet connects to the
      | :th:`choice_list_name` column on the **choices** worksheet.
  * - validation_tags
    - | Space-separated list of validation tags.

  * - value
    - | The value of the property to set

For example, the following configuration specifies that the default view for the table is the list view (HTML). It also defines the detail view, list view, and map view HTML files. And, for the map view, it defines the color rule to apply to the pins in the map view and the latitude and longitude columns to use in displaying those pins.

.. _xlsx-ref-calculates:

Calculates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **calculates** worksheet is an optional worksheet.

.. list-table:: Calculates Worksheet Columns
  :header-rows: 1
  :name: calculates-worksheet-columns

  * - Column
    - | Description
  * - calculation_name
    - | The name used to reference the calculation in other worksheets.
  * - calculation
    - | The JavaScript formula to be evaluated.


Each row of the **calculates** page represents a function that can be used elsewhere in the workbook by referencing the individual :th:`calculation_name`. The :th:`calculation` column can store any valid JavaScript expression. In general,

.. note::

  Calculations are referenced in the :th:`condition` column of **survey** worksheets.

.. tip::

  There are  built in functions for `ODK-X Survey <https://docs.odk-x.org/survey-using/>`_ that can be used anywhere in the workbook. See the :ref:`Formula Functions <xlsx-ref-formula>` section for more details.

If a complex calculation is required, you can access the full power of Javascript and the :program:`jquery.js` (that is: :code:`$.some_func(...)` ) and :program:`underscore.js` (that is: :code:`_.some_func(...)` ) libraries. Internally, the calculate column is wrapped and evaluated as a Javascript function:

.. code-block:: javascript

  function() {
      return (YOUR_CALCULATE_COLUMN_CONTENT_HERE);
  }

You can write your own code to perform a join via defining and invoking an anonymous function in your calculate. Here is an example:

.. code-block:: javascript

  (function() {
      var result = "";
      _.each(data('valueListField'), function(element) {
          result = result + ", " + element;
      });
      return result.substring(2);
  }) ()

This defines a function and then invokes it. The available functions within a calculates expression are the following:

.. list-table:: Available Calculates Functions
  :header-rows: 1
  :name: available-calculates-functions

  * - Function
    - | Description
    - Usage
  * - :code:`data(fieldName)`
    - | Retrieve the value stored under this fieldName
    - :code:`data('myField')`
  * - :code:`metadata(instanceMetadataFieldName)`
    - | Retrieve value stored under this name
    - :code:`metadata('_group_modify')`
  * - :code:`selected(promptValue, qValue)`
    - | Test whether qValue occurs within a select-multiple
    - :code:`selected(data('mySelectMultipleField'),'myChoiceDataValue')`
  * - :code:`countSelected(promptValue)`
    - | Count the number of selections in a select-multiple
    - :code:`countSelected(data('mySelectMultipleField'))`
  * - :code:`equivalent(promptValue1, promptValue2, ...)`
    - | Test if values are equivalent
    - :code:`equivalent(data('promptA'), data('promptB'))`
  * - :code:`not(conditional)`
    - | Negate a condition ( equivalent to !(conditional) )
    - :code:`not(data('fieldA') === data('fieldB'))`
  * - :code:`now()`
    - | Return the current time
    -
  * - :code:`isFinalized()`
    - | Return whether or not the current row is finalized
    -
  * - :code:`assign(fieldName, value)`
    - | Store value in fieldName and return value.
    - :code:`(8 + assign('myField', 5))*10`

Additionally, the following functions are also available, but are generally not useful in calculates. They are used within template helper functions (:file:`…/system/survey/js/handlebarsHelpers.js`).

.. list-table:: Template Helper Functions
  :header-rows: 1
  :name: template-helper-functions

  * - Function
    - | Description
    - Usage
  * - :code:`getCurrentLocale()`
    - | Return the currently-active locale
    -
  * - :code:`localize(locale, displayProperty)`
    - | Localize the given display.xxx text
    - :code:`localize(getCurrentLocale(), display.hint)`
  * - :code:`width(string)`
    - | Determine the rendered width of a string
    -
  * - :code:`expandFormDirRelativeUrlPath(content)`
    - | Return url for a file within the form directory.
    -

And, finally, you can also reference the *opendatakit* object (that is: :code:`opendatakit.some_func(...)` ) within these functions (:file:`system/survey/js/opendatakit.js`).


.. _xlsx-ref-choices:

Choices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **choices** sheet allows you to specify the set of choices for multiple choice prompts.

.. list-table:: Choices Worksheet Columns
  :header-rows: 1
  :name: choices-worksheet-columns

  * - Column
    - | Description
  * - choice_list_name
    - | The name used to reference the set of choices. This name must be the same
      | as the :th:`values_list` in the **survey** worksheet.
  * - data_value
    - | The value that gets stored as the user’s response.
  * - display.title
    - | A string token identifying the translation entry with the text shown to
      | the user for this choice value.
      |
      | Alternatively, this column can be omitted and this text can be
      | specified directly via the :th:`display.title.text` column.
  * - display.title.text
    - | The text that the user sees for this choice.
  * - display.title.image
    - | An image that the user will see associated with a particular choice.


The :th:`choices` worksheet in the XLSX file whose :th:`form_id` matches the :th:`table_id` should have all the choice lists. These choice lists are the ones that get written to the :file:`properties.csv`

.. _xlsx-ref-model:

Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **model** sheet is an optional sheet that allows you to specify the data model for the :th:`table_id` specified in the **settings** worksheet.

.. list-table:: Model Worksheet Columns
  :header-rows: 1
  :name: model-worksheet-columns

  * - Column
    - | Description
  * - name
    - | The name of the data field to be used in :th:`table_id`
  * - type
    - | The type of data that can be put into this :th:`data_field` of the table.
  * - isSessionVariable
    - | Whether or not this field is a session variable
      | (not persisted -- defaults to false).

Many more columns can be specified, including a :th:`default` column or, as shown in the exampleForm, a :th:`default[0]` column to initialize the first element (index zero) of a select multiple field. Default values cannot be calculates and must be simple literal values (integers, numbers and strings). The :th:`elementType` column can be used to modify how the database is created. For example, as shown in the datatypes XLSX, string variables' length can be adjusted from a default of 255 to other lengths with string(len).

.. _xlsx-ref-queries:

Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **queries** worksheet is an optional sheet that allows you to request data from external sources for use in :tc:`select` prompts. These are some of the things you can do with queries:

  - Connect to website APIs.
  - Get data from external Android Applications via file content providers.
  - Get data from a linked table
  - Open CSV files included in the survey's directory.
  - Pass key-value maps to :th:`linked_table` forms when creating or opening that form.

.. list-table:: Queries Worksheet Columns
  :header-rows: 1
  :name: queries-worksheet-columns

  * - Column
    - | Description
  * - query_name
    - | The name used to reference the information returned by
      | the query.
  * - query_type
    - | Legal value are :tc:`ajax`, :tc:`csv`, and :tc:`linked_table`.
      | Used to specify the provenance of the query data.
  * - uri
    - | Used by :tc:`ajax` and :tc:`csv` queries. The uri to use
      | for an :tc:`ajax` query or the name of the CSV file to
      | use relative to the location of the :file:`formDef.json`
      | file.
  * - callback
    - | Used by :tc:`ajax` and :tc:`csv` queries. The function
      | that will be used to map the query results to the set of
      | choices for a multiple choice prompt.
  * - linked_table_id
    - | Used by :tc:`linked_table` queries. The :th:`table_id`
      | used to identify the table that the data will come
      | from. This should match the :th:`table_id` provided
      | in the **settings** worksheet.
  * - linked_form_id
    - | Used by :tc:`linked_table` queries. The id of the form
      | that will be used to get the results for the
      | :tc:`linked_table`. This value should match the
      | :th:`form_id` value in the **settings** worksheet.
  * - selection
    - | Used by :tc:`linked_table` queries to filter results
      | when used with :tc:`selectionArgs`. Specifies the
      | conditions that must be true for the results to be
      | selected but must have :tc:`selectionArgs` to work.
  * - selectionArgs
    - | Used by :tc:`linked_table` queries to filter results
      | when used with :th:`selection`. The arguments to be
      | used in the :th:`selection` described above.
  * - orderBy
    - | Used by :tc:`linked_table` queries to specify the
      | order in which results should be returned.
  * - newRowInitialElementKeyToValueMap
    - | Used by :tc:`linked_table` queries. A Javascript
      | object containing key value pairs used to assign
      | initial values when creating a new row in the
      | linked table. The key is the element name in the
      | linked form. The value is the initial value to
      | assign to the element.
  * - openRowInitialElementKeyToValueMap
    - | Used by :tc:`linked_table` queries. A JavaScript
      | object containing key value pairs used to assign
      | initial values when opening an existing row in the
      | linked table. The key is the element name in the
      | linked form. The value is the initial value to
      | assign to the element.

The two columns :th:`newRowInitialElementKeyToValueMap` and :th:`openRowInitialElementKeyToValueMap` allow you to pass information from your originating form into the linked form. The element keys in these maps correspond to the element keys in the linked form (not the current form). These can refer to any of the form's fields; commonly, the values you would pass into the :th:`openRowInitialElementKeyToValueMap` would refer to session variables. You would typically pass the :th:`instanceID` of the originating form (that is: :code:`opendatakit.getInstanceID()` ) into the linked form when creating it so that you can store that id in a field in that linked table, thereby tying the newly-created row in that table back to the originating form's row.

.. _xlsx-ref-user-defined:

User Defined Section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A custom named section is essentially a subset of the **survey** worksheet. Thus, all of the columns that were described in the :ref:`survey <xlsx-ref-survey>` section are applicable in a custom section worksheet. However, the following worksheet names are reserved and cannot be used to name a custom section worksheet:

  - settings
  - properties
  - choices
  - queries
  - calculates
  - column_types
  - prompt_types
  - model
  - framework_translations
  - common_translations
  - table_specific_translations

.. _xlsx-ref-custom-prompt-types:

.. _xlsx-ref-built-in:

Built-in Functionality
--------------------------

The :program:`jquery` and :program:`underscore` libraries are available when defining calculates expressions or writing statements for the :th:`condition` column or the :th:`required` column.

`ODK-X Survey <https://docs.odk-x.org/survey-using/>`_ exposes built-in functionality through formula functions to decrease form development time.

.. _xlsx-ref-formula:

Formula Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following formula functions can be used to simplify calculations or expressions.

.. list-table:: Built in formula functions
  :header-rows: 1
  :name: built-in-formula-functions

  * - Name
    - | Description

      | to the field and return the value
    - :code:`assign('fieldname',value)`
  * - :code:`countSelected`
    - | Returns the number of items selected from a
      | :tc:`select_multiple` prompt
    - :code:`countSelected(data(‘options’))`
  * - :code:`data`
    - | Returns the value of a field or session variable.
    - :code:`data(‘options’)`

      | into the function.
    - :code:`selected(data('visited_continents'), 'NorthAmerica')`

And, additionally, the *opendatakit* object is also available for use in calculates expressions.

.. warning::

  The *opendatakit* object contains many useful functions but these should be considered internal methods subject to change. When upgrading, be sure to confirm that the methods you use have not disappeared!

.. _xlsx-ref-javascript:

JavaScript Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The built-in formula functions can be combined in advanced ways using any valid JavaScript expression. This is particularly useful for creating complex condition statements to implement skip patterns or conditional statements for required variables. JavaScript operators will allow the expressions to involve more than one variable or more than one response from a single variable. Parentheses can be used in creating particularly complex conditions. A few basic JavaScript operators:

.. list-table:: Basic JavaScript operators
  :header-rows: 1
  :name: basic-javascript-operators

  * - Name
    - Description
    - Example
  * - :code:`&&`
    - And
    - :code:`data('person_age')>=18 && selected(data('pizza_type'), 'mushroom')`
  * - :code:`||`
    - Or
    - :code:`(selected(data('pizza_type'), 'mushroom') || selected(data('pizza_type'), 'onions')`
  * - :code:`==`
    - Equal
    - :code:`data('person_number') == 1`
  * - :code:`===`
    - Strict equal of the same type
    - :code:`data('consent')==="yes"`
  * - :code:`>=`
    - Greater than or equal to
    - :code:`data('age') >=18`
  * - :code:`<=`
    - Less than or equal to
    - :code:`data('age') <=17`

.. Tip::

  Make sure that statements using :code:`&&` and :code:`||` operators for variables that were :th:`select_one` type are logical and that they work as intended. For example, if the variable :code:`pizza_type` had been a :th:`select_one`, the statement :code:`(selected(data('pizza_type'), 'mushroom') && selected(data('pizza_type'), 'onions')` could never be valid, because the respondent could only have selected one or the other or neither, not both. Therefore, the example instead uses a :code:`||` statement.
