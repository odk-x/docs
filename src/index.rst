.. _odk-x-introduction:
--------------
The ODK-X Tool Suite is free and open-source software for collecting, managing, and using data in resource-constrained environments.

In ODK-X developers and data managers can create data management applications that consist of survey forms as well as Javascript-based apps. These allow you to render a fully customizable user interface to gather, manage, and visualize data on an Android device.

A major goal of these ODK-X tools was to eliminate the need for any software engineering skills (for example: Java programming, Android software development environment, source code version control systems) when designing data management applications. The skills required to build a data management application range from scripting a form definition in XLSX (similar to constructing ODK Collect forms using XLSX files processed by the XLSForm tool), to simple web programming -- modifying boilerplate HTML and JavaScript for custom presentations of the collected data. Advanced web programmers can implement entirely custom web pages.

Key features
------------

.. _odk-x-two-way-data:

Two-way data sync
"""""""""""""""""
A two-way synchronization protocol allows you to create data management applications with:

 - Follow-up surveys and repeat data collection locations

 - Pre-filled forms for faster data collection

 - Data can be synced to all devices from the server through manual trigger by the user, by clicking the sync button.

.. _odk-x-offline-data:

Offline data collection
"""""""""""""""""""""""
Allows users to collect data without an internet connection. Form data can be synced to the server when the user has internet access.

.. _odk-x-linked-surveys:

Linked and embedded surveys
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""
ODK-X tools enable you to open and edit other surveys with links back to the originating survey. Create a sub-form (nested) relationship among surveys (for example: household and household-member) or relational links across your data (for example: tea-houses and tea-types).

.. _odk-x-view-on-device:

View data on device
"""""""""""""""""""
Investigate and visualize entire datasets directly on the device through graphical, map, tabular displays, and filtered views.

.. _odk-x-uac:

User access control
""""""""""""""""""""
Control data viewing, editing, and deleting privileges for different users and groups.

.. _customize-flows-and-appearance:

Customizable survey flows and appearance
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Use basic web development (HTML, JavaScript, and CSS) to specify the layout of nearly all the screens viewed by the data collectors.

.. _odk-x-intro-list-of-tools:

List of Tools
--------------
The ODK-X Tool Suite consists of:

  - :doc:`survey-using` - a customizable data **collection** application.
  - :doc:`tables` - a data **curation and visualization** application that can also run custom-built data collection workflows.
  - :doc:`services` - an application for **user authentication and data synchronization** between the ODK-X applications.
  - :doc:`cloud-endpoints-intro` - a **cloud server** to host data and application files, and to support bi-directional data synchronization across mobile devices.
  - :doc:`suitcase-intro` - a **desktop tool** for synchronizing data with a cloud endpoint.
  - :doc:`app-designer-intro` - a design environment for **creating, customizing, and previewing** your forms, data curation, and visualization applications. This is where you build your ODK-X applications.

.. note::
  ODK-X mobile applications are available for Android devices only.

.. _odk-x-intro-selecting-the-right-tools:

Selecting the Right Tools to Use
--------------------------------

The ODK-X tools can operate independently â€“ you are not required to use all the tools, or even install them on your device. Some example tool combinations are:

.. _odk-x-data-collection:

Field data collection
"""""""""""""""""""""

 - ODK-X Application Designer: data collection form creation
 - `ODK-X Survey <https://docs.odk-x.org/survey-using/>`_: data collection
 - ODK-X Services: data sync and database access
 - ODK-X Cloud Endpoints: data and application files cloud server

.. _data-sharing-and-visualization:

Data sharing and visualization
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

 - ODK-X Tables: data display and visualization
 - ODK-X Services: data sync and database access
 - ODK-X Cloud Endpoints: data and application files cloud server

See :doc:`reference-apps` for examples of ODK-X tools in use.

.. _odk-x-intro-trying-it-out:

Trying It Out
-------------

The :doc:`survey-sample-app` walks you through the process of using a basic survey-focused application and submitting data to the server.
The :doc:`tables-sample-app` walks you through the process of using a basic tables-focused application and submitting data to the server.
