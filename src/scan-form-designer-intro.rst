ODK-X Scan Form Designer
============================

.. _scan-form-introduction:

ODK-X Scan uses the :dfn:`ODK-X Scan Form Designer` to create machine-readable forms. Scan is only compatible with forms created in the Scan Form Designer and loaded onto the phone. They can then be chosen among the templates within ODK-X Scan and successfully processed on the device.

Find the Scan Form Designer inside a tab in the :doc:`app-designer-intro` using :program:`Google Chrome`.

.. warning::

  You muse use :program:`Google Chrome`; other web browsers are not compatible at this time.

A basic overview of the steps to design a form are:

  #. Set the page style
  #. Add images and data fields
  #. Save form (for future editing) and Export form to ODK-X Scan app
  #. Print form for users to complete by hand

You can begin using the Scan app once you've got a form template and forms with handwritten data entered.

Video tutorials for each of these steps --from designing to exporting your form template-- are available `as a YouTube playlist <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLInM3bDqDAn-liFsahcdHQxtjSHWQIw83>`_.

Once you have exported your completed form you can transfer the form template to the ODK-X Scan app and begin scanning paper forms. See the :doc:`scan-intro` documentation for more on those next steps.
