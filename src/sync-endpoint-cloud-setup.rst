Setup ODK-X Sync Endpoint with Cloud Services
=============================================

This tutorial will help you launch ODK-X Sync Endpoint on a virtual machine hosted on a cloud service provider.  ODK-X Sync Endpoint communicates with your ODK-X Android applications in order to synchronize your data and application files.

| There are 3 main options that we have documented to set up ODK-X Sync Endpoint
|   :ref:`1.  DigitalOcean console <sync-endpoint-setup-digital-ocean>`
|   :ref:`2.	Azure console <sync-endpoint-setup-azure>`
|   :ref:`3.	Amazon Web Services console <sync-endpoint-setup-aws>`

.. note::
  The apps require at least *2GB* of space to run, therefore, at least *4GB* of space is recommended for the server (for example - a droplet on DigitalOcean).

.. _sync-endpoint-setup-domain:

Step 0: Acquire a domain name or subdomain
------------------------------------------

Running the ODK-X Sync Endpoint in the cloud will require access to a publicly registered domain name to allow for a secure connection between Android devices and the Sync Endpoint. Domain names can be purchased via many providers. We have used `Google Domains <https://domains.google.com/>`_, `Amazon Route 53 <https://aws.amazon.com/route53/>`_, Azure App Services Domains, and `Cloudflare Registrar <https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/>`_ successfully.

If you already own a domain, you may add a subdomain record for use with Sync Endpoint without purchasing a whole new domain. Before you go on, make sure you have a domain and know how to log into your domain management console to add a DNS record!

.. note::
  Specific instructions for connecting ODK-X Sync Endpoint to your domain will vary based on your registrar and DNS provider.

.. _sync-endpoint-setup-digital-ocean:

Option 1: DigitalOcean console
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| If you'd like to set up an ODK-X server that's accessible from anywhere via the Internet, DigitalOcean provides a one-click configuration that's nicely geared with nearly all the tools you'll need to set up your new server. The only thing it doesn't do is register a domain name, which you will have to do in order to obtain a security certificate for your server. These instructions walk you through:
|   -	:ref:`Setting up a DigitalOcean account <sync-endpoint-setup-digital-ocean-account>`
|   -	:ref:`Setting up a Droplet, DigitalOcean’s name for a server you can access and manage <sync-endpoint-setup-digital-ocean-droplet>`
|   -	:ref:`Setting up a DNS record <sync-endpoint-setup-digital-ocean-dns>`
|   -	:ref:`Enabling a firewall to prevent unintended traffic <sync-endpoint-setup-digital-ocean-firewall>`
|   -	:ref:`Connecting to your Droplet <sync-endpoint-setup-digital-ocean-connecting>`
|   -	:ref:`Launching the ODK-X Server <sync-endpoint-setup-digital-ocean-launching>`

.. _sync-endpoint-setup-digital-ocean-account:

Setting up a DigitalOcean account
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

   :width: 600

4. On the :guilabel:`Firewalls` tab of the :guilabel:`Networking` page,  and click on the :guilabel:`Create Firewall` button.

  .. image:: /img/setup-digital-ocean/do-firewall.png
   :width: 600

5. Set a name for your firewall and modify the inbound rules to match the inbound rules specified in the picture below (SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS). Attach the firewall to the desired droplet. Leave the outbound rules as-is and click on the :guilabel:`Create Firewall` button.

  .. image:: /img/setup-digital-ocean/do10.png
   :width: 600

  .. image:: /img/setup-digital-ocean/do11.png
   :width: 600

.. _sync-endpoint-setup-digital-ocean-connecting:

Connecting to your Droplet
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

1. On the droplet page, click on the :guilabel:`Console` link in the upper-right corner of the page

  .. image:: /img/setup-digital-ocean/do-console.png
   :width: 600

2. A console window will now open up. If you chose the **password** authentication, you will be asked to enter your username and then asked for a password.

  .. image:: /img/setup-digital-ocean/do-console-terminal.png
   :width: 600

3. Before running our launch scripts, you need to check your logs to ensure that all the packages have been successfully installed, which should take about 2-3 minutes. The droplet may also reboot in this time.

  | Use the following command to get into the log directory.

  .. code-block:: console

    $ cd /var/log

  Now, open the log file with command:

  .. code-block:: console

    $ tail cloud-init-output.log

  .. image:: /img/setup-digital-ocean/do-check-logs.png
   :width: 600

  If you see the message **“The system is finally up, after X seconds”** you can proceed to the next step! Otherwise, continue to wait and check the log file again.

4. In order to run our launch scripts, we must first navigate back to
   the root directory with the following command:

  .. code-block:: console

    $ cd /home/root

  Now, we can run our build scripts with the command:

  .. code-block:: console

    $ ./script_to_run.sh

  .. image:: /img/setup-digital-ocean/do-run-script.png
   :width: 600

  The script will ask you for the server's domain and an
  administration email address to configure https on the server.

  .. image:: /img/setup-digital-ocean/do-prompt.png
   :width: 600

  After gathering this data the script will begin the install and you
  should see a bunch of statements executing in your console. Wait
  approximately 5-10 minutes for the installation to complete.

  Once all the services have been created, we need to check if all the services are running properly with the command:

  .. code-block:: console

    $ docker stack ls

  .. image:: /img/setup-digital-ocean/do5.png
   :width: 600

  If there are 9 (or 7 without https) services running under the name `syncldap`, everything is running properly.
5. Next, set up SSH tunneling for the Sync Endpoint admin portal. This is the recommended method of accessing the admin interface rather than leaving port 40000 open on the firewall. You can find detailed instructions on how you can do this on the :ref:SSH tunneling <ssh-tunneling> page.

6. Now, navigate to https://localhost:local_port within your browser in order to access the services screen. It will warn you about your connection not being private but should give you the option to proceed at the bottom.

  .. image:: /img/setup-digital-ocean/do7.png
   :width: 600

7. If you see the following screen after proceeding, you are good to go!

  .. image:: /img/setup-digital-ocean/do8.png
   :width: 600

8. Read our section on :ref:`Creating a Sample User <sync-endpoint-setup-create-user>` to learn how to create a user from within the admin interface.

.. _sync-endpoint-setup-digital-ocean-launching:

Launching the ODK-X Server
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

1. Navigate to http://[IP_ADDRESS]/web-ui/login in order to access the login screen.

  .. image:: /img/setup-digital-ocean/do13.png
   :width: 600

  Once a user has been created in the admin interface, this is the login screen that the user will use to log in and access their data.

.. _sync-endpoint-setup-azure:

Option 2: Azure console
-------------------------

| We have noticed that sync-endpoint runs the smoothest on Azure. These instructions will walk you through the following:
| -	:ref:`Setting up an Azure account <sync-endpoint-setup-azure-account>`
| -	:ref:`Setting up a virtual machine <sync-endpoint-setup-azure-vm>`
| -	:ref:`Setting up a DNS record <sync-endpoint-setup-azure-dns>`
| -	:ref:`Connecting to your virtual machine <sync-endpoint-setup-azure-connect>`
| -	:ref:`Launching the ODK-X Server <sync-endpoint-setup-azure-launch>`

.. _sync-endpoint-setup-azure-account:

Setting up an Azure account
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

1. If you haven’t already, create an account on `Azure <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/>`_.

.. _sync-endpoint-setup-azure-vm:

Setting up a virtual machine
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

1. First, click on the :guilabel:`Virtual Machines` button underneath the **Azure Services** section on the portal. Then, open the :guilabel:`Create` dropdown and choose :guilabel:`Azure virtual machine`  to initiate the creation of a new virtual machine.

  .. image:: /img/setup-azure/azure1.png

  .. image:: /img/setup-azure/azure2.png
   :width: 600

  .. image:: /img/setup-azure/azure3.png
   :width: 600

2. On the **Basics** pane, select your Azure subscription, create a new resource group to attach to the virtual machine by clicking on :guilabel:`Create new`. Additionally, enter a name for the virtual machine, select a region and select *Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS* as the image.

  .. image:: /img/setup-azure/azure4.png
    :width: 600

  .. image:: /img/setup-azure/azure5.png
    :width: 600

3. Scroll down and select your authentication type. We highly recommend that use an SSH key for authentication. Copy and paste your SSH key username, and the key itself.

  You can refer to a guide on `creating an SSH key <https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/add-ssh-keys/create-with-openssh/>`_ for detailed instructions.

  Alternatively, Azure now provides an option to automatically generate an SSH key pair (As highlighted in the figure below). This key .pem file can then be directly downloaded to the user's computer for future use to connect to the virtual machine.

  .. image:: /img/setup-azure/azure6.png
    :width: 600

4. Go to the **Networking** tab, enable Public inbound ports, and select HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), and SSH (22) from the dropdown menu.

  .. image:: /img/setup-azure/azure7.png
    :width: 600

5. Click the **Advanced** tab at the top and copy and paste the contents from the :download:`cloud_init_AZURE.yml </files/cloud_init_AZURE.yml>` file into the *Custom data* box.

  .. image:: /img/setup-azure/azure8.png
    :width: 600

  This startup script simplifies ODK-X Sync Endpoint installation by automating package updates, Docker setup, and initialization. You would just need to run the script that will be created (script_to_run.sh).

6. Finally, click :guilabel:`Review + create` to actually create the machine. If you had generated the SSH key pair through Azure automatic generate key pair option, then it now gives you a prompt to download the key (.pem) file. It is important to download it and remember the path to this file in your computer for connecting to virtual machine later.

    :width: 600

.. _sync-endpoint-setup-azure-dns:

Setting up a DNS Record
"""""""""""""""""""""""

1. Within the Virtual Machine overview section, locate the IP address
   of your machine.

  .. image:: /img/setup-azure/azure12.png
    :width: 600

2. Log into your account for your domain name registrar and DNS
   provider. See :ref:`Acquiring a domain
   name<sync-endpoint-setup-domain>` for more information and a list
   of registrars and DNS providers.

3. Add a dns 'A' record for the domain or subdomain you would like to
   use for the Sync Endpoint with your droplet's IP address.


.. _sync-endpoint-setup-azure-connect:

Connecting to your virtual machine
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

1. Within the Virtual Machine overview section, locate the IP address of your machine.

  .. image:: /img/setup-azure/azure12.png
    :width: 600

2. Open up a terminal window and enter the command

  .. code-block:: console

    $ ssh -i PATH_TO_PRIVATE_KEY USERNAME@IP_ADDRESS

  The first parameter represents the *path to your private key* you used for SSH authentication (in case of automatic generation through Azure, it is the path of the key pair .pem file downloaded earlier in your computer), the second parameter *the username* you used for SSH authentication, and the final parameter *the IP address* of the virtual machine.

3. Before running our launch scripts, we need to check our logs to ensure that all the packages have been successfully installed, which should take about 2-3 minutes. The virtual machine may also reboot in this time.

  | Use the following command to get into the log directory.

  .. code-block:: console

    $ cd /var/log

  Now, open the log file with command:

  .. code-block:: console

    $ tail cloud-init-output.log

  If you see the message **“The system is finally up, after X seconds”** you can proceed to the next step! Otherwise, continue to wait and check the log again.

4. In order to run our launch scripts, we must first navigate back to
   the home directory with the following command:

  .. code-block:: console

    $ cd /home/ubuntu

  Now, we can run our build scripts with the command:

  .. code-block:: console

    $ sudo ./script_to_run.sh

  The script will ask you for the server's domain and some questions (as shown in the picture below) along with an administration email address to configure https on the server.

  .. image:: /img/setup-azure/prompts.png
    :width: 600

  After gathering this data the script will begin the install and you should see a bunch of statements executing in your console. Wait approximately 5-10 minutes for the installation to complete.

  .. image:: /img/setup-azure/setupcomplete.png
    :width: 600

  Once all the services have been created, we need to check if all the services are running properly with the command:

  .. code-block:: console

    $ sudo docker stack ls

  To see all of the Docker processes/containers that are actively running, use the following command:

  .. code-block:: console

    $ sudo docker ps

  .. image:: /img/setup-azure/dockerprocesses.png
    :width: 600

  If there are 9 (or 7 without https) services running under the name
  `syncldap`, everything is running properly.

  There should be 9 services (or 7 without https) as shown by docker stack ls while 7 services (or 6 without https) actively running as shown by the command ``docker ps``.

5. Next, set up SSH tunneling for the Sync Endpoint admin portal. This is the recommended method of accessing the admin interface rather than leaving port 40000 (the port on which the admin portal is running) open on the firewall. This ensures that the admin interface is not publicly accessible. Detailed instructions on how to set up SSH tunneling can be found on the :ref:`SSH tunneling <ssh-tunneling>` page.

  .. image:: /img/setup-azure/azure14.png
   :width: 600

6. If you see the following screen after proceeding, you are good to go!

  .. image:: /img/setup-azure/azure15.png
