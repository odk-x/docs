SSH Tunneling for ODK-X Sync Endpoint
============================================

Secure Shell (SSH) tunneling provides a secure way to access services remotely. The following instructions explain how to set up an SSH tunnel to access the admin portal for the ODK-X Sync Endpoint deployed in a cloud environment.

1. Open your terminal or command prompt on your local machine and run the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

     $ ssh -L <local_port>:<server_ip>:40000 <user>@<ssh_server>

Replace the placeholders with your actual values.

2. Once connected, you've created an SSH tunnel, allowing you to access the admin portal locally. Go to https://localhost:local_port to access the admin portal.
