Layout of Application Files
-------------------------------------

The layout of a Data Management Application is as follows:

  - :file:`/sdcard/opendatakit`-- directory containing all ODK-X applications. Each application is a sub-directory within this directory.
  - :file:`/sdcard/opendatakit/default` -- default application name (directory) for the ODK-X tools

Within the application folder (:file:`/sdcard/opendatakit/default`), the following directories are present:

  - :file:`config` -- contains read-only configuration files that define the user's application (for example, the 5demos example application you just synced from https://opendatakit-tablesdemo.appspot.com). Within this folder are:

      - :file:`assets` -- contains files that initialize your data tables (in the csv sub-folder) and define the custom home screen and provides CSS files for overall appearance of your app, and JavaScript libraries and files for common behaviors in your app.
      - :file:`tables` -- contains directories that are named with table ids. Within these sub-directories, the `ODK-X Survey <https://docs.odk-x.org/survey-using/>`_ forms and table-specific HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files are found. For example, the HTML file describing the list view for the tea houses table is found in :file:`config/tables/Tea_houses/html/Tea_houses_list.html`.

  - :file:`data` -- contains the database and row-level attachments (files).
  - :file:`output` -- contains files that are generated (such as detailed logging files) or exported (such as CSV files) by the ODK-X tools on the device.
  - :file:`system` -- an area maintained by the tools themselves (`ODK-X Survey <https://docs.odk-x.org/survey-using/>`_, :doc:`tables`, ODK-X Scan, and so on). These files are extracted and placed here by the APKs. You should not modify files in this folder; when first started, the ODK-X tools sweep this directory to verify that these files match their internal copy. Any deviant file is replaced with a fresh internal copy.

The automatic configuring and loading of data into :doc:`tables` is governed by the :file:`config/assets/tables.init` file. It provides a list of table ids and the CSV files (located in the :file:`config/assets/csv` folder) that should be imported to populate them. This is discussed in more detail in the :ref:`Tables User Guide <tables-managing-config-at-startup>`.

.. note::

  This file is the only configuration file that is not synced to the server. This is to optimize start-up of your application on other devices; once this initial data has been loaded into your data tables and synced to the server, the other devices will obtain the data through an ordinary sync action.

.. note::

  This file is scanned once. If the import(s) fail, it could leave some tables partially initialized. The file will be re-processed and data rows re-loaded by clicking on :menuselection:`Reset Configuration` on the :guilabel:`Settings` screen then exiting the ODK-X Tools and re-launching them. Upon being re-launched, the file will be scanned and processed.

Most of the app-level settings that are configured through the :menuselection:`Settings` page are stored in the :file:`config/assets/app.properties` file. Excluded from this file are the :guilabel:`Server Sign-On Credential type`, and the values for that credential (such as username and password). This allows the application designer to specify and enforce most of the app-level settings (such as the server used when syncing) via the sync mechanism.
