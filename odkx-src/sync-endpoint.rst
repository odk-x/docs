ODK-X Sync Endpoint
===================

.. _sync-endpoint-intro:

:dfn:`ODK-X Sync Endpoint` is an implementation of :doc:`cloud-endpoints-intro`. It runs a server inside a :program:`Docker` container that implements the `ODK-X REST Protocol <https://docs.odk-x.org/odk-2-sync-protocol/>`_.

It communicates with your ODK-X Android applications to synchronize
your data and application files.

Depending on your needs, ODK-X Sync Endpoint can either be installed
in a cloud-based virtual machine, or on your own infrastructure.

- :ref:`Cloud-based Setup<sync-endpoint-cloud-setup>`
- :ref:`Manual Setup (on local infrastructure)<sync-endpoint-manual-setup>`

.. _sync-endpoint-auth:

Authentication
--------------

ODK-X Sync Endpoint does not store user information in its own database, instead it integrates with an *LDAP* directory or an *Active Directory*. That directory is then used to authenticate users and obtain user roles.

.. note::

  As a consequence of the integration, Basic Authentication is the only supported authentication method.


.. _sync-endpoint-https:

HTTPS
-----

  The Sync Endpoint stack integrates support for automatic certificate
  provisioning via domain validation and letsencrypt. For most use
  cases this should be sufficient. Certificate provisioning parameters
  can be edited interactively during initialization or directly in
  :file:`config/https.env`.

  .. Tip:: For advanced users, if you would like to use an externally
           provisioned certificate one can be added by modifying the
           cert-bootstrap service in :file:`docker-compose-https.yml`
           to pull from the appropriate external files. Additionally
           docker's built in secrets and config infrastructure can be
           used directly to expose the certificate and key only to the
           NGINX container.

.. _sync-endpoint-ldap:

LDAP
----

  - The default admin account is  *cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org*.
  - The default password is *admin* - it can be changed with the *LDAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD* environment variable in :file:`ldap.env`

  - The default readonly account is *cn=readonly,dc=example,dc=org*.
  - The default password is *readonly* - it can be changed with the *LDAP_READONLY_USER_PASSWORD* environment variable in :file:`ldap.env`. This account is used by the Sync Endpoint to retrieve user information.

The LDAP directory that you deployed with the instructions above is an :program:`OpenLDAP` server. In addition to the directory, a :program:`phpLDAPadmin` server is also deployed to help you configure the directory.

If you'd prefer to use the :program:`OpenLDAP` command line utilities, they're installed in the OpenLDAP container. These tools are accessible with this command:

  - Linux/macOS:

  .. code-block:: console
 
    $ docker exec $(docker ps -f "label=com.docker.swarm.service.name=syncldap_ldap-service" --format '{{.ID}}') LDAPTOOL ARGS

  - Windows:

  .. code-block:: console

    $ docker exec (docker ps -f "label=com.docker.swarm.service.name=syncldap_ldap-service" --format '{{.ID}}') LDAPTOOL ARGS

.. note::

  The phpLDAPadmin server listens on port 40000, it is important that you do not expose this port to the internet.

The following guides assume that you're using :program:`phpLDAPadmin`. In order to perform the following operation, please go to https://127.0.0.1:40000 in your browser.

.. _sync-endpoint-ldap-utils:

Using LDAP utils
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

  The ldap-service container has ldap-utils installed. If you'd prefer, you may use that tool set to administer the LDAP directory as well. Use this command to
  access them,
 
    .. code-block:: console
  
     $ docker exec $(docker ps -f "label=com.docker.swarm.service.name=${STACK_NAME}_sync" --format '{{.ID}}') <LDAPTOOL> <ARGS>
     
    The docker exec takes a container name and a command . The command is executed in the specified container . 
    
.. _sync-endpoint-advanced:

Advanced
--------

.. _sync-endpoint-ldap-defaults:

Editing the defaults of LDAP directory
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
    Modify the ldap.env file to configure the environment variables . The default settings are as follows 
    
      .. code-block:: console
      
       # openldap
       LDAP_ORGANISATION=Open Data Kit            // name of your organisation
       LDAP_DOMAIN=example.org                    // domain of your organisation
       LDAP_READONLY_USER=true                    // enable the read only user
       LDAP_READONLY_USER_PASSWORD=readonly       // password for read only user
       LDAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin                  // default password for admin account 

       # phpldapadmin
       PHPLDAPADMIN_LDAP_HOSTS=ldap-service   // This is for the phpLDAPadmin . In docker swarm this is the name of the service running LDAP . This can be eddited
                                                 in the docker-compose.yml file
                                                 
   
.. _sync-endpoint-custom-ldap:

Using a Different LDAP directory
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
    
    1. Create a folder in the sync-endpoint-default-setup directory and create a docker file inside it .
    
    2. Copy the bootstrap.ldif file from the OpenLDAP directory to the new directory .In the docker file Add the image of the ldap directory to be used and add 
       the "COPY" command to copy the bootstrap.ldif file to the right path in the container .
    
    3. Run the following command to build the docker image :
    
     .. code-block:: console
  
       $ docker build -t odk/[LDAP_DIRECTORY_NAME] [ Folder conatining the docker file ]
       
    4. Replace the ldap-service image from docker-compose.yml with odk/[LDAP_DIRECTORY_NAME].
    
    5. Modify config/sync-endpoint/security.properties to fill in the Settings for LDAP server.
       Set security.server.ldapUrl in security.properties to the new server url . The name of the service in swarm would be same ( ldap-service ) . So just change 
       the port number .
    
.. _sync-endpoint-ldap-ui:

Using a Different LDAP UI
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
    
    If you want to use a UI outside the docker swarm in your local machine Modify the docker-compose.yml file in sync-endpoint-default-setup directory . Add ports 
    mapping to the ldap service to expose the port 389 of ldap service to a port in your local host . If you wish to access 
    the ldap protocol over TLS/SSL expose the port 636. Connect the UI application to this port on localhost.
    
    The ldap service of the the docker compose should be like this after adding port mapping .
    
    .. code-block:: console
        
      ldap-service:
       image: odk/openldap
       deploy:
        replicas: 1
       networks:
        - ldap-network
       ports:
        - "YOUR_LOCAL_HOST_PORT:389"    // 389 is the default port of openLDAP 
       volumes:
        - ldap-vol:/var/lib/ldap
        - ldap-slapd.d-vol:/etc/ldap/slapd.d
       env_file:
        - ldap.env 
    
    
    For running the UI application in the docker swarm create a folder in the sync-endpoint-default-setup directory and create a docker file inside it .
    Copy the templates folder from the phpLDAPadmin directory to the new directory . In the docker file ,add the image of the UI application to be used and the 
    "COPY" command to copy the templates folder to the right path inside the container .
    
    To build the docker image run the command in the sync-endpoint-default-setup-directory with tag odk/[YOUR_UI_APPLICATION_NAME] :
    
     .. code-block:: console
  
       $ docker build -t odk/[YOUR_UI_APPLICATION_NAME] [ Folder conatining the docker file ]
       
    Edit the docker-compose.yml file . Replace the image of phpLDAPadmin service with odk/[YOUR_UI_APPLICATION_NAME] . 
    
    
.. _sync-endpoint-dhis2:    

Managing Identity through DHIS2
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
    Modify config/sync-endpoint/security.properties to fill in the Settings for DHIS2 Authentication section
    Set security.server.authenticationMethod in security.properties to dhis2
    [OPTIONAL] Remove OpenLDAP and phpLDAPadmin from docker-compose.yml .

    After restarting your Sync Endpoint server, you will be able to login to Sync Endpoint using the same credentials you use
    for your DHIS2 server. DHIS2 organization units and groups, with membership preserved, will be converted to Sync Endpoint
    groups and accessible through the Sync Endpoint REST API.\
    
.. _sync-endpoint-warnings:

Warnings
--------
 - The database and the LDAP directory set up here are meant only for testing and evaluation. When running in production you should configure a production ready 
   database and a production ready LDAP directory. Using the pre-configured database and directory in production can result in poor performance and degraded 
   availabilitiy.
 - You should refer to Docker Swarm documentation on running a production ready Swarm.
 - We recommend that you host Sync Endpoint on a commercial cloud provider (e.g. Google Cloud Platform, Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, etc.) If you want to host 
   Sync Endpoint on premise, you should consult your System Administrator for appropriate hardware.
 - Always make regular backups and test your backups to prevent potential data loss.
