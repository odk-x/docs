Installing ODK-X Basic Tools
================================

These instructions describe the steps to install the ODK-X basic tools on a tablet.

.. _basic-prereqs:

Prerequisites
-------------------

- An Android tablet with an operating system version 4.4 or higher. If you are working on a Windows/Mac/Linux machine, you can use `Android Studio <https://developer.android.com/studio>`_ to launch an Android emulator for testing purposes.
- Android 10 with API level less than 30 for version 2.1.7.
  Please note that ODK-X Services version 2.1.7 doesn't work on Android 11.
- The following third party app: `OI File Manager <https://github.com/openintents/filemanager/releases>`_.

Required
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are no other ODK-X Android tools that are prerequisites to installing ODK-X Services. However, ODK-X Services is a prerequisite for all the other ODK-X Android tools.

Recommended
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We also recommend installing both ODK-X Survey and ODK-X Tables. Having both is not required, but Tables and Survey are most versatile when used together. Tables offers a way to visualize, process, and modify data collected by Survey, all on the device.  Survey offers a simple, form based data collected workflow similar to ODK Collect that can be seamlessly integrated with Tables to create and modify records.

Installing Services
--------------------------------

  1. From your device's :guilabel:`Settings`, choose :menuselection:`Apps & notifications`. (On older versions of Android, this setting maybe in :menuselection:`Applications` or :menuselection:`Security` depending upon your Android version.)

    - Go to :guilabel:`Special app access` in :guilabel:`Advanced` and choose :guilabel:`Install unknown apps`
    - From the list of applications, select a browser of your choice and check :guilabel:`Allow from this source`.
    - (On older versions of Android, above two steps are not required, make sure installation from *Unknown Sources* is checked.)

  2. Open the same web browser that you authorized to install unknown apps on your Android device. (For older versions of Android any web browser can be used since you do not need to specifically authorize the web browser's ability to install.)
  3. Navigate to https://github.com/odk-x/services/releases/latest and download the latest ODK-X Services APK.
  4. In the download window, you will see ODK_Services_vN.N.N.apk. - Select it to download the file.

   - On older devices, the APK will automatically install after you approve the security settings.
   - On newer devices, you must go to the download list, rename the file to restore the .apk extension (the extension will have been renamed to .man during the download process), then click on it to install it.

.. note::

  You can also `download the ODK-X Services APK <https://github.com/odk-x/services/releases/latest/>`_ to your computer and load it on your device via `adb <https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html>`_ or another tool like `AirDroid <https://www.howtogeek.com/105813/control-your-android-from-a-browser-with-airdroid/>`_.

.. tip::

  You can also `install ODK-X Services on an Android emulator <https://github.com/odk-x/tool-suite-X/wiki/Developer-Environment-Setup>`_. However, this can be slow and is only recommended for developers actively working on Services.
