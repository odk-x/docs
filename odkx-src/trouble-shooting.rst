Troubleshooting
=====================

In this guide, we cover the likely problems you *might* encounter installing and configuring the ODK-X basic tools. The ODK-X basic tools are :doc:`services`, :doc:`tables` and `ODK-X Survey <https://docs.odk-x.org/survey-using/>`_. 

Do ensure that you have followed all the instructions for installation stated in the :doc:`basics-install` page.

--------------------

This section covers issues that are specific to the Android device you are working with and how to solve these problems.

.. note::
  The ODK-X basic tools require an Android device with a version 4.4 or higher operating system. 
    
Certain **Tecno** and **Infinix** devices run specific system settings which prevent applications from running in the background to conserve battery life. For the ODK-X applications to work, they need to be able to run in the device background. 

You will typically run into issues as a result of these devices' system setting. Users with these devices will notice that the Survey and Tables applications do not start and the screens are stuck on a configuring loop.

To solve for this, you have to enable :guilabel:`Auto-start` for the ODK-X applications on your device.
