Users and Groups
=================

.. _sync-endpoint-ldap-users:  

A user needs to be assigned to a group within ODK-X Sync Endpoint to set their permissions and roles for ODK-X apps. 
More information about groups and roles is available in :ref:`Data Permission Filters<data-permission-filters>` section.

The instructions below assumes you have access to the phpLDAPAdmin web administration interface. Note that this is not enabled by default, 
so you may want to enable it by following the instructions in the :doc:`sync-endpoint-pla-webaccess` documentation.



Creating users
--------------------

  1. Click: :guilabel:`login` on the left and login as *admin*.
      | Start by logging into the ldap-service. Copy the login below.
      |  - login DN: :guilabel:`cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org`
      |  - password: :guilabel:`admin` (or the password you chose in the setup wizard)

  2. Expand the tree view on the left until you see :guilabel:`ou=people`.
     Click the :guilabel:`+` sign next to **dc=example, dc=org** to expand it. Within the unfolded menu, in the **ou=people** section, click on :guilabel:`Create a child entry` (new person).
