Tea Houses Demo
=====================

.. _tables-sample-app-tea-houses:

For this portion of the tutorial, we will explore the *Tea Houses* demo. Select the tab labeled :guilabel:`Tea` and press :guilabel:`Launch Demo`.

  .. image:: /img/tables-sample-app/tables-sample-launch-tea.*
    :alt: Launch Tea Houses
    :class: device-screen-vertical

The *Tea Houses* demo is a fictional collection of Tea Houses in Benin and the teas they offer.

.. _tables-sample-app-custom-view:

Custom View
---------------------

The first screen you will see after launching the *Tea Houses* demo is a custom view.

  .. image:: /img/tables-sample-app/tables-sample-tea-custom.*
    :alt: Tea Houses Custom Navigation
    :class: device-screen-vertical

As with the custom home screen, this custom view is rendered entirely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript defined within the *Tea Houses* demo. It does not collect or present data, it acts as a navigation screen to allow the user to choose which of the three data set to interact with.

Custom views are not limited to navigation and workflow interfaces. They can also be used to view data, create data visualizations, and modify data in the database. The :doc:`tables-sample-app-plot` and :doc:`tables-sample-app-jgi` explore this more fully.

Press the button labeled :menuselection:`View Teas` to launch the *List View* of the available teas.

.. _tables-sample-app-list-view:

List View
----------------------

  .. image:: /img/tables-sample-app/tables-sample-tea-list.*
    :alt: Tea Houses List View
    :class: device-screen-vertical

This screen shows a list of all teas available in the *Tea Inventory* data table. This view is customized with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a simple way to view and navigate collected data. As new teas are added to the inventory, this list view will grow.

To see the raw data, we will switch to *Spreadsheet View*. Tap on the lined paper icon at the top of the screen. Here you’ll see all the possible view types. Select :menuselection:`Spreadsheet`.

.. _tables-sample-app-spreadsheet-view:

Spreadsheet View
------------------------

  .. image:: /img/tables-sample-app/tables-sample-spreadsheet.*
    :alt: Tea Houses Spreadsheet View
    :class: device-screen-vertical

This view renders a full data table from the database, including all rows and columns. Unlike the views we have seen so far, this view is NOT customized via HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This view is provided by the ODK-X platform for convenience in viewing and editing your data directly. It is meant to be a familiar view as if you were looking at it on a spreadsheet program, such as :program:`Excel`. Each row here represents a tea, and each was a row in the *List View*.

Return to the *List View* by using the lined paper icon as before and selecting :menuselection:`List`. Tap the :menuselection:`Stonehouse` tea to launch a *Detail View* for that tea.

.. _tables-sample-app-detail-view:

Detail View
---------------------

  .. image:: /img/tables-sample-app/tables-sample-tea-detail.*
    :alt: Tea Houses List View
    :class: device-screen-vertical

This screen shows all the details of the *Stonehouse* tea entry in the *Tea Inventory* table. The *Tea Inventory* table's *Detail View* displays information about the tea, including whether it is available hot, iced, in bags, or loose leaf. Note that the tea type is being pulled from the *Tea Types* table, but the JavaScript is getting the information from that table to construct our view. Like the other views, we programmed this using rudimentary HTML and JavaScript, but it could be customized to look fancier or display additional information.

Next, we will see a combination of the detail and list view options. Back out until you hit the custom view with the three buttons. .. _tables-sample-app-detail-view-learn-more:

.. _tables-sample-app-detail-sublist-view:

Detail With Sublist View
-----------------------------

From the custom view with the three buttons, select :guilabel:`View Tea Houses`. This will launch another *List View*, this time showing the list of tea houses.

  .. image:: /img/tables-sample-app/tables-sample-tea-houses-list.*
    :alt: Tea Houses List View
    :class: device-screen-vertical

The *Tea Houses* table has been configured to use a *Detail With Sublist View* rather than a *Detail View*. Tap the :guilabel:`Tea for All` tea house to see this.

  .. image:: /img/tables-sample-app/tables-sample-tea-detail-sublist.*
    :alt: Tea Houses Detail With Sublist View
    :class: device-screen-vertical

This screen contains a *Detail View* webpage and a subordinate *List View*. In this case, the *Detail View* displays information on the tea house, and the *List View* displays the teas that the tea house serves. Within the *Detail View*, you can scroll down to see the information we decided to display. It is also written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to render these table entries. The look-and-feel is similar to the *Tea Inventory* only because that is how we coded it. Like the *List View*, we programmed this using very rudimentary HTML and JavaScript, but it could be customized to look fancier or display additional information.

Scroll to the bottom of the *Detail View* portion of the screen and you’ll see a link as a number of teas. This is using the information in the table called *Tea Inventory* to tell you how many teas this tea house offers, and has also been defined in the JavaScript.

The bottom half of the screen renders the subordinate *List View*, which shows the list of teas available at the *Tea for All* teahouse. It is a separate page that is controlled by the top half.

.. note::

  This is a simple example that has a static list. However, you could dynamically change the list that is rendered with controls in the JavaScript for the top half of the screen. For example, you could have a household detail on top, and list all family members on the bottom. You could then provide a button to change the list to only show adult family members in the list below.


Next we will see the *Map View*. Back out of the *Detail With Sublist View* to see the list of tea houses. Press the lined paper icon and choose :menuselection:`Map` from the menu.

.. _tables-sample-app-map-view:

Map View
----------------------

  .. image:: /img/tables-sample-app/tables-sample-map.*
    :alt: Tea Houses Map View
    :class: device-screen-vertical

All the fictional tea houses in Benin appear on the map. Pinch and squeeze or widen to zoom out and in, respectively. The tea house location is plotted based on what appeared in the *Location_latitude* and *Location_longitude* columns in the database. These can be viewed with the :ref:`tables-sample-app-spreadsheet-view`. When you click on a map marker, the *List View* will redraw with that marker's information at the top of the *List View*.

The *List View* at the top portion of the screen is rendered in custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but the map portion is provided by the ODK-X platform and rendered using :program:`Google Maps`.

.. _tables-sample-app-edit-with-survey:

Edit Row With Survey
---------------------------

The final portion of the *Tea Houses* demo will be to edit data with Survey. Return to the *List View* by using the lined paper icon as before and selecting :menuselection:`List`. Tap the :menuselection:`Tea for All` tea house to launch a *Detail With Sublist View* for that tea. Tap the pencil icon in the upper right.

  .. image:: /img/tables-sample-app/tables-sample-tea-detail-sublist-edit.*
    :alt: Tea Houses Launch Survey
    :class: device-screen-vertical

This will launch Survey to edit the *Tea for All* row in the *Tea Houses* data table.

  .. image:: /img/tables-sample-app/tables-sample-survey-launch.*
    :alt: Tea Houses Survey Tea for All
    :class: device-screen-vertical

This Survey form allows you to edit any and all of the data fields in the *Tea for All* entry. Navigate to the question that reads:

  *Which tea is the house specialty*

  .. image:: /img/tables-sample-app/tables-sample-survey-edit.*
    :alt: Tea Houses Survey Tea for All Edit
    :class: device-screen-vertical

Change the specialty to be Herbal. Complete the form and finalize the changes. When you return to the *Tea for All* detail page you will see the house specialty has been updated to Herbal.

  .. image:: /img/tables-sample-app/tables-sample-update-value.*
    :alt: Tea Houses Updated Value
    :class: device-screen-vertical

Similarly, this action can be taken from a *List View* by using the :guilabel:`+` button in the upper right.

Tables and Survey are built to integrate seamlessly. Data can be visualized in Tables and edited in Survey, with your organizations complex workflow moving between as needed. A more complex example of this will be shown later in this tutorial with the :doc:`tables-sample-app-hope`.

.. note::

  Survey is often the easiest way to edit data. However, Tables offers JavaScript APIs to directly edit data through your own custom user interfaces.


This concludes the *Tea Houses* demo. Next we will open the *Geotagger* Demo.
