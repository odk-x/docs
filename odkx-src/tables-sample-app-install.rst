Install the Sample Application
==================================

Prerequisites
---------------

:ref:`Install ODK-X Tables <tables-install>` and its prerequisites from the guide :doc:`basics-install`.

.. _tables-sample-app-install:

Unlike ODK Collect, the ODK-X tools are application-focused. An application is identified by the name of the directory under the :file:`/sdcard/opendatakit/` folder. The sample application is named *default*, as is the sample applications provided for :doc:`survey-using`. This means that you can only deploy one of these sample application at a time onto a device. We also provide :ref:`instructions <survey-launching-appname>` to rename one of these so that two or more applications can co-exist and not interfere with each other on this same device.

We will use the ODK-X synchronization mechanism to install this app. It is about 26 MB in size and takes a few minutes to download from the web.

  1. Launch ODK-X Tables. Press the Action Button (:guilabel:`â‹®`) and press :menuselection:`Preferences` from the menu.

  2. Follow the :ref:`services-managing-server-config` instructions to set up your server.

    - Set your :guilabel:`Server URL` to :file:`https://tables-demo.odk-x.org/`.

      .. note::

        The server URL starts with :file:`https://` not :file:`http://`. Don't forget to include the *s*.

    - Click on Server Sign-on Credential and change your authentication from  :guilabel:`None (anonymous access)` to :guilabel:`Username`. Then, click Username, and enter :menuselection:`demo_user1` in the space. Also change your server password to :menuselection:`password`.

      .. tip::

        You can also :ref:`login by scanning a QR code.<services-login-with-qr>`

  3. Back out until you return to Tables.
  4. Follow the :ref:`services-using-sync` instructions (see :ref:`launching from Tables <services-using-sync-launch-other>`).

    - Again, leave your user as :menuselection:`None (anonymous access)`.
    - Leave the file attachment setting to :menuselection:`Fully Sync Attachments`

After synchronization is complete, your device's configuration will exactly match that of the server. This includes both collected data and application level files (such as form definitions and HTML files). If you had nothing on your device before, your device will be populated with this data and these application files. If you already had files on this device in this application namespace they will be updated to match the server version. Any local configuration files for data tables or forms that are not present on the server will be removed from your device. Everything under the :file:`/sdcard/opendatakit/default/config` directory will be revised to exactly match the content on the server.

Once the configuration and data on the device is an exact match to that of the server, the file attachments associated with those data are synchronized. If you have a slow connection, it may take two or three tries before the sync is successful. This will not overwrite or hurt anything to do multiple synchronizations in a row.

When complete, click :guilabel:`OK` on the :guilabel:`Sync Outcome` dialog and back out of the Services, returning to Tables.

.. note::

  If there are merge conflicts, click :guilabel:`Take Server Version - Discard Local Changes` to resolve it.


If the sync was successful, ODK-X Tables will scan through the downloaded configuration, updating its list of available forms.

After this configuration is set up, ODK-X Tables should now present a custom home screen with five tabs, one for each of the demos. If it does not, back out of ODK-X Tables and re-launch it.
