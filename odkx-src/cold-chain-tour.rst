Cold Chain Guided Tour
========================

.. _cold-chain-tour:

This document guides you through the :doc:`cold-chain-intro`, named Cold Chain. This application is stateful and does not have a single workflow to follow. Therefore it is organized by area of interest, with each classification broken down into different workflows and modules contained within it. Each individual module contains both a brief description of the purpose and function of the module, as well as an overview of how that functionality is implemented.

You can view a visual walk through of the Cold Chain workflows `here <https://youtu.be/qX6VJnI6JnM>`_ on our YouTube channel.

.. note::

  All file paths in this document are inside of the Application Designer directory. Additionally, all user-defined files in a Data Management Application are inside the :file:`app/config/` directory. For convenience, this document omits these portions of the file paths.

  For example, let us assume I have stored the Application Designer directory on my computer in :file:`/home/bobsmith/workspace/app-designer`. If this guide were to reference a file as :`assets/index.html` that indicates the file located on my computer at :file:`/home/bobsmith/workspace/app-designer/app/config/assets/index.html`.
